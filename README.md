This is an experimental project trying to do Acoustic Echo Cancellation on
Android, using AEC module from Speex lib and OpenSL ES API.

This project started from Victor Lazzarini's android-audiotest, which
"demonstrates streaming audio IO on android with OpenSL ES, by plugging the
mono input from the audio device into its stereo output."
